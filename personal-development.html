    My goal is to achieve web designer status. I have the required qualifications<br> and am seeking 
    to obtain the practical experience necessary to apply my skills. <br>
    Three of my strenghts are the ability to adjust, the ability to learn and the ability to make the <br>best out of every situation.
    Within the last three to five years I have made serveral <br> financial decisions that have imporved my way of life and my mind set.

    <h3> Summary of Chapters 4 – 7 of “Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</h3>
<p>Chapter four to seven speaks to Goal setting. The authors stated that individuls <br>
    should decide where they want to go and then design a plan to get there.<br>
  There will be many oportunities however choose wisely. Your best opportunity each day<br>
   are those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on. <br>
   Don’t just go through the day, get from the day. Don’t spend you time on urgent, spend <br>
   your time on what is important. 
   Don't join an easy crowd, do what you need to elevate.<br>Choose avenues that challenge you 
   not what makes you comfortable. Successful people<br> look for relationships with other successful
   people who will push them, challenge them,<br> and encourage them to become better. To attract
   attractive people, you must be attractive. <br>  Not physically but mentally and who you are.
   Formal education will make you a living. <br> Self education will make you a fortune. Self-education is what you teach yourself.<br> 
   It is what you  learn along the way so that you are constantly improving and growing. <br>Most people don’t continue to learn and grow, to separate yourself
    from <br> everyone else, be focused on continuous learning.

<h3>How Chapters 4 – 7 of “Twelve Pillars” can apply to me</h3>
<p>I can apply what I have read from Chapters 4 – 7 of “Twelve Pillars” by setting realistic goals,<br>
  only taking the opportunities that suit my goals and developement. I can also avoid the herd mentality <br>
  and focus on what makes me unique and captalize on that. I can also conduct self education and do lots of<br>
  of self education and self investing. </p>
